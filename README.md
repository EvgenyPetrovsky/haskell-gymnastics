# haskell-gymnastics
short exercises for having practice with Haskell

* `codewars` problems from https://www.codewars.com
* `project-euler` problems from https://projecteuler.net
* `spotify-puzzles` puzzles by Spotify engineers from https://labs.spotify.com/puzzles/
* `sicp` exercises from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" 2-nd edition (https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) originally intended for Scheme but implemented in Haskell

Please be aware - this repository contains solutions, so be careful if you don't want to spoil them.

Repository also contains individual codebase

* `other` implemetation of useful generic functions
* `simulations` individually chosen ideas for implementation. For example casino roulette: game definitions and play strategies.
